# Pencil Drawer for SwiftUI
*PencilDrawerForSwiftUI* is a Swift package that provides a SwiftUI component to let users draw in your SwiftUI app without going through the complicated PencilKit API and using the simple binding system of the SwiftUI framework.

## Usage

The `PencilKit` APIs store pencil drawings as plain binary data, represented in Swift by the `Data` type. All you need to do is to define a `Data` binding variable and pass it to the `DrawingView` view as it follows:

```swift
struct UsageExample: View {
    
    @State private var drawing: Data = Data()
    
    var body: some View {
        DrawingView(drawingData: $drawing, drawingPolicy: .anyInput, drawingChanged: { updatedData in
            // Handle changes in the drawing
            // ...
            
        })
    }
    
}
```

The changes to the data will be reflected in the canvas, and updates from the canvas will be synchronized with the data thanks to the SwiftUI binding system.

As you can see, you can also choose the drawing policy between:
- `default`: the default input type to use for drawing on a canvas.
- `anyInput`: allows drawing on the canvas from any input source.
- `pencilOnly`: pencil touches are the only input that draw on the canvas.
